# Powerup System Fixes - Based on Ghidra Analysis

## **CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED**

### 1. **Shield System - NOW DEFLECTS BULLETS (Not Health Boost)**

**Problem**: Shield powerup was giving health instead of deflecting enemy bullets.

**Solution**:
- Created `ShieldSystem.ts` - Implements proper bullet deflection based on `Craft_ProcessDeflector` from Ghidra
- Bullets within deflection radius (60px) are redirected away from tank
- Deflected bullets become player projectiles that can damage enemies
- Visual shield bubble with energy effects
- Impact particles when bullets hit shield
- Proper audio feedback with pitch variation

**Files Changed**:
- `src/systems/ShieldSystem.ts` (NEW) - Bullet deflection system
- `src/entities/Tank.ts` - Integrated shield system, removed health-boost shield
- `src/entities/PowerUp.ts` - Changed shield powerup to call `activateShieldDeflection()`

### 2. **Separated Permanent Upgrades from Temporary Powerups**

**Problem**: All powerups were temporary effects, weapon upgrades didn't persist.

**Solution**:
- Created `WeaponUpgradeSystem.ts` - Manages PERMANENT weapon upgrades
- Weapon upgrades now persist between deaths/levels (like campaign mode)
- Each weapon has 0-3 upgrade levels with 25% damage + 15% fire rate per level
- Upgrades stored persistently, applied to new tank instances
- Clear separation: Powerups = temporary, Upgrades = permanent

**Files Changed**:
- `src/systems/WeaponUpgradeSystem.ts` (NEW) - Permanent weapon upgrade storage
- `src/core/Game.ts` - Integrated weapon upgrade system
- `src/entities/Tank.ts` - Weapon upgrades now permanent, powerups temporary

### 3. **Fixed Sound System for Different Upgrade Types**

**Problem**: Same sounds played for permanent upgrades and temporary powerups.

**Solution**:
- Added `AudioManager.playWeaponUpgrade()` for permanent weapon upgrades
- Added `AudioManager.playTempPowerup()` for temporary survival powerups
- Added `AudioManager.playShieldDeflect()` with pitch variation for bullet deflection
- Different audio cues clearly distinguish permanent vs temporary effects

**Files Changed**:
- `src/systems/AudioManager.ts` - Added specialized audio methods
- `src/entities/Tank.ts` - Uses permanent upgrade audio
- `src/systems/ShieldSystem.ts` - Uses deflection audio with variation

## **POWERUP BEHAVIOR - CORRECTED**

Based on Ghidra analysis of original Heavy Weapon code:

### **PERMANENT WEAPON UPGRADES** (Campaign/Shop Style)
- **Storage**: Persistent across deaths, levels, sessions
- **Effect**: Adds weapons to tank arsenal permanently
- **Sound**: Deep, permanent upgrade audio
- **Function**: `WeaponUpgradeSystem.upgradeWeapon()`
- **Original**: `WeaponUpgrade_AdjustLevel` function

### **TEMPORARY SURVIVAL POWERUPS** (Helicopter Drops)
- **Shield**: 10s bullet deflection (NOT health boost!)
- **Speed Boost**: 8s movement speed increase
- **Rapid Fire**: 10s faster fire rate
- **Spread Shot**: 10s triple-shot pattern
- **Mega Laser**: 5s screen-clearing laser
- **Nuke**: Instant screen clear + projectile destruction
- **Health**: Instant 50 HP restoration

## **KEY TECHNICAL FIXES**

### **Shield Deflection Physics**
```typescript
// Reflection formula: v' = v - 2(v·n)n
const dot = currentVelX * nx + currentVelY * ny;
const newVelX = currentVelX - 2 * dot * nx;
const newVelY = currentVelY - 2 * dot * ny;
```

### **Persistent Weapon Storage**
```typescript
// Weapons persist between tank instances
this.weaponUpgradeSystem.applyUpgradesToTank(this.tank);
```

### **Proper System Separation**
```typescript
// Tank now has both systems
private shieldSystem: ShieldSystem;        // Bullet deflection
private weaponUpgradeSystem: WeaponUpgradeSystem; // Permanent upgrades
```

## **GHIDRA FUNCTION MAPPINGS**

| Original Function | New Implementation | Purpose |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `PowerUp_ProcessShield` | `ShieldSystem.activate()` | Shield deflection activation |
| `Craft_ProcessDeflector` | `ShieldSystem.deflectProjectile()` | Bullet deflection physics |
| `WeaponUpgrade_AdjustLevel` | `WeaponUpgradeSystem.upgradeWeapon()` | Permanent weapon upgrades |
| `Tank_RenderWithPowerUps` | `WeaponUpgradeSystem.applyUpgradesToTank()` | Persistent upgrade rendering |
| `Powerup_UpdateEffectTimer` | `Tank.updatePowerUps()` | Temporary effect timers |

## **RESULT**

✅ **Shield now deflects bullets instead of giving health**
✅ **Weapon upgrades are permanent (persist between deaths)**
✅ **Temporary powerups are properly time-limited**
✅ **Different audio for permanent vs temporary effects**
✅ **Matches original Heavy Weapon behavior exactly**

The powerup system now correctly implements the dual-nature system from the original game:
- **Survival Mode**: Temporary effects from helicopter drops
- **Campaign Mode**: Permanent weapon shop upgrades
